# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database to replace the current local state management and localStorage implementation in the handloom business management system. The system currently has modules for billing, purchases, expenses, borrowed money tracking, and reports that need to be connected to a persistent database with proper API endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want all my business data to be stored in a persistent database, so that I don't lose any information when the application is closed or refreshed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM
2. WHEN any data is created, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL persist the changes to the database
3. WHEN the application is refreshed THEN the system SHALL retrieve all data from the database instead of localStorage
4. WHEN the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to manage customer billing with proper data relationships, so that I can track customer purchase history and payment details accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a bill THEN the system SHALL store customer information, bill items, and payment details in related database tables
2. WHEN a customer makes multiple purchases THEN the system SHALL maintain the relationship between customer and their bills
3. WHEN viewing billing history THEN the system SHALL display bills with proper customer and item relationships
4. WHEN calculating totals THEN the system SHALL use database aggregation functions for accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track inventory purchases with supplier relationships, so that I can manage my supply chain effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording a purchase THEN the system SHALL store product, supplier, and purchase details in the database
2. WHEN a supplier provides multiple products THEN the system SHALL maintain supplier-product relationships
3. WHEN viewing purchase history THEN the system SHALL display purchases with supplier and product information
4. WHEN checking stock status THEN the system SHALL reflect real-time inventory levels from the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track all business expenses with proper categorization, so that I can analyze my spending patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording an expense THEN the system SHALL store expense details with proper categorization in the database
2. WHEN viewing expense reports THEN the system SHALL group expenses by category and date ranges
3. WHEN calculating total expenses THEN the system SHALL use database queries for accurate calculations
4. WHEN filtering expenses THEN the system SHALL support date range and category-based filtering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track borrowed and lent money with detailed transaction history, so that I can manage my financial obligations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording a money transaction THEN the system SHALL store transaction type, person details, and terms in the database
2. WHEN viewing outstanding amounts THEN the system SHALL calculate net positions from database records
3. WHEN tracking repayments THEN the system SHALL link repayments to original borrowing transactions
4. WHEN generating financial summaries THEN the system SHALL use database aggregations for accuracy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to generate comprehensive reports from database data, so that I can make informed business decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL query database tables with proper joins and aggregations
2. WHEN applying date filters THEN the system SHALL use database date functions for efficient filtering
3. WHEN calculating profit/loss THEN the system SHALL use database queries to compute accurate financial metrics
4. WHEN exporting reports THEN the system SHALL format database results for presentation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API endpoints for all data operations, so that the frontend can interact with the database through a clean interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs data THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints for all entities
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL validate data before database operations
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and transaction management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want user authentication to be integrated with the database, so that user sessions and permissions are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate against database user records
2. WHEN managing user roles THEN the system SHALL store role-based permissions in the database
3. WHEN tracking user sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain session data in the database
4. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL use proper password hashing and session management
